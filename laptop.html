    <h2>Online Third Places</h2>
    <p>It can be argued that third places exist on the internet, too. Online third places, as explored by Parkinson, Schuster, L., & Mulcahy (2022) and Soukup (2006), represent digital environments that play a pivotal role in shaping social interactions and well-being.  <br><br>
      Online third places cannot be defined by a single medium–they emerge from “computer mediated communication contexts” like Discord, MMORPGS, comment sections, and chat rooms. These online spaces can serve as ‘social refuges' and attempt to cultivate a third place-like environment. <br><br>
      Although online third places are able to replicate the comparable sense of social space as traditional third places in the physical world, most researchers agree that they lack the same level of interactivity that can be found in local cafes, gyms, and churches. <br><br>
      “Managing the balance between online engagement and real-world interactions is crucial for sustaining positive well-being outcomes.”
