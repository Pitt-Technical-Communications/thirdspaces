This project is tailored for a 16:9 touchscreen kiosk, featuring an educational interactive scene set in a bustling cafe. Users engage with people and objects to explore the significance of sociologist Ray Oldenburg's concept of "Third Places" â€” social spheres bridging the gap between work and home.
