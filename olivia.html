    <h2>Loss of Third Places</h2>
    <p><b>Olivia:</b> Hi, I'm Olivia. When I moved to this town, I was so glad to find this coffee shop. You know, after Covid hit, I saw so many coffee shops close down. It's a bummer; I don't even think we have one in my hometown anymore.<br><br> 
      <b>Olivia:</b> Did you know that third places have been disappearing all across the country? I just came across a study that looked at data from the National Establishment Time-Series, a database of the US economy, and it found that the food and beverage establishments have declined by 23 percent since the Great Recession. Can you believe that?<br><br>
      <b>Olivia:</b> Almost all categories of third places, especially commercial establishments and privately-run organizations, have declined since 2011 and 2012. It's really quite concerning. <br><br>
      <b>Olivia:</b> Even the classic American main street, you know, the walkable commercial center with a mix of services, public spaces, and locally-owned businesses, has been struggling for decades.<br><br>
      <b>Olivia:</b> Oh, it just reminds me of how lucky I am to have this place!</p>
