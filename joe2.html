    <h2>Third Places and Community Health</h2>
    <p><b>Barista Joe:</b> Living in areas with a lack of third places is associated with poorer physical and mental health. The routine of going to third places can act as buffers against stress, loneliness, inactivity, and alienation, especially for people don’t have many places to be social.<br><br>
      <b>Barista Joe:</b> Third places encourage people to be physically active and socially connected to others. These factors aren’t just social perks; they come with clear health implications, positively impacting our patrons.<br><br>
      <b>Barista Joe:</b> Baristas like myself, for example, we act as community guardians. Just by making coffee for our regulars, we’re able to keep tabs and check in on community members. The loss of protective factors, like those found in third places, can be particularly challenging for vulnerable groups. This includes older adults, children, and those facing socio economic hardships. <br><br>
      <b>Barista Joe:</b> For example, one of my favorite customers is Mary, who is 80 years old and comes in every morning at 7:00 am sharp. She has a tab here so that she can coordinate her payments with her monthly welfare checks, and we always ask her if she’s keeping up with her medical appointments. These are just small parts of our routines as guardians of third places, but these acts have a significant social impact. </p>
