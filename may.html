    <h2>Coworking in Third Places</h2>
    <p><b>May:</b> Hi there, I'm May! You caught me at the perfect time, I just got out of a client call. My name’s May, and I come to this a few times a week to tackle my remote work when I don’t feel productive doing it at home. I think it’s called a “coworking space”? <br><br>
      <b>May:</b> These spaces really challenge the traditional notions of workplaces and where creative work happens. They shake up how people who work outside of an office interact with each other and their environment, blurring the lines between work and what they call a 'third space.'<br><br>
      <b>May:</b> Studies show that, at least for creative work like writing, art, and design, being surrounded by others and everyday life creates a more productive work environment. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but having this affordable, communal space really amps up my productivity.<br><br>
