    <h2>Discord as a Third Place</h2>
    <p>You’ve probably heard about discord, the platform that allows communication through voice calls, video calls, text messaging, and media and files. While it was originally a video game chat platform, “Citron and his team realized that the best thing about their game was the chat feature. (Not a great sign for the game, but you get the point.)”<br><br>
      The CEO of Discord wants the platform to become the default third place, describing it like "a neighborhood, or like a house where you can move between rooms.”<br><br>
      While other social platforms have attempted to replicate becoming the internet's third place, no one has come as close as Discord. With the ability to enter into different channels and communicate in a variety of ways, Discord is a uniquely authentic third place.
