    <h2>Third Places on College Campuses</h2>
    <P><b>Nithin:</b> Hey. I’m Nithin, a junior at the University of Pittsburgh. Normally I would be doing work at the library, but it’s way too busy during finals week.<br><br>
      <b>Nithin:</b> College campuses are some of the only places in the US that really emphasize walkable communities and an abundance of third places. I mean, where else can you get to a study room, a cafeteria, three different cafes, a library, bars, gyms, and parks all within a few steps? <br><br>
      <b>Nithin:</b> Universities know why this is important too–many schools track how often on-campus residents swipe into dining halls or libraries and are able to predict the likelihood that the student will be able to graduate based on that. <br><br>
      <b>Nithin:</b> So basically, the more students engage with third places, the more likely they will do well in school!
